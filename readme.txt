A Gutenberg block to connect Discord accounts with customizable buttons and support for membership plugin add-ons.

== Description ==

**Custom connect button block for Discord** is a powerful Gutenberg block that enables users to connect their Discord accounts directly from any page or post.
This block provides full customization options, including button text, colors, and styles, while dynamically displaying the user's connection status.

Unlike traditional shortcodes, this block supports custom design variations based on the specific post or page it’s used on — giving you full control over layout and context-aware styling.

✨ Behind the scenes, the block uses a server-side rendering mechanism that allows you to toggle between edit mode and live preview directly within the block editor. With Play/Stop controls, you can instantly view the real frontend output — exactly as it will appear to users — without needing to save the post or switch to the frontend.

### Supported Add-ons:
This block is compatible with the following plugins:
- [ExpressTech MemberPress Discord Add-on](https://wordpress.org/plugins/expresstechsoftwares-memberpress-discord-add-on/)
- [PMPro Discord Add-on](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pmpro-discord-add-on/)
- [Connect Tutor LMS to Discord](https://wordpress.org/plugins/connect-tutorlms-to-discord/)


### Features:
- Real-time live preview in the editor with a Play/Stop toggle to see the exact frontend output instantly.
- Connect Discord accounts using a fully customizable button.
- Display the user's Discord role if connected.
- Show a "Disconnect" button for users who are already linked.
- Compatible with multiple membership plugins (PMPro, MemberPress, Ultimate Member, Tutor LMS).
- No coding required – customize everything visually in the block editor.
